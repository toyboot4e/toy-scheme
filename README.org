* toy-scheme.el
  Handle custom local path schemes defined in =schemes.txt=

** Motivation
   =toy-scheme.el= is primary for my game development. When we write files that refer to other
   files, we want something better than relative path.

   =schemes.txt= is a list of /custom local path schemes/. If you write /schemed path/ in syntax
   =<scheme>:<content>=, it can be converted to =<scheme_path>/<content_path>= referring to
   =schemes.txt=.

** Example
    Say we have many files:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    assets/
    ├── map
    │   ├── tileset
    │   │   └── tileset-1.png
    │   ├── tmx
    │   │   └── map-data-1.tmx
    │   └── tsx
    │       └── tileset-1.tsx
    └── scripts
        └── script1.lisp
    #+END_SRC

    If we want to refer to =map-data-1.tmx= from =script1.lisp=, we have to write as
    =../map/tmx/map-data-1.tmx=. This is uncomfortable!
    Instead, we can write it as ="map:map-data-1.tmx"= if we define =assets/schemes.txt=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   ROOT: .

   map: map
   tmx: map/tmx
   tsx: map/tsx
   tileset: map/tileset
   #+END_SRC
